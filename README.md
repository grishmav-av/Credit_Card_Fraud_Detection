# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Due to the potential for huge financial losses, credit card theft is a serious problem for both  financial institutions and consumers. Algorithms that use machine learning are frequently  used to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.The Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree machine learning methods for credit card fraud 
detection are examined in this research. A dataset on actual credit card fraud was used for the study. This study's major goal is to evaluate the algorithms' abilities to spot fraudulent 
transactions by contrasting and comparing them. The findings show that, though with variable degrees of success, all four algorithms may be used to detect credit card fraud. This study adds to the body of knowledge by revealing information on how well various machine learning algorithms work to identify credit card fraud. The main goal is to identify fraud by filtering 
the aforementioned methods to get a better result.
