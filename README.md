# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Due to the potential for huge financial losses, credit card theft is a serious problem for both  financial institutions and consumers. Algorithms that use machine learning are frequently  used to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.The Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree machine learning methods for credit card fraud 
detection are examined in this research. A dataset on actual credit card fraud was used for the study. This study's major goal is to evaluate the algorithms' abilities to spot fraudulent 
transactions by contrasting and comparing them. The findings show that, though with variable degrees of success, all four algorithms may be used to detect credit card fraud. This study adds to the body of knowledge by revealing information on how well various machine learning algorithms work to identify credit card fraud. The main goal is to identify fraud by filtering 
the aforementioned methods to get a better result.

## RESEARCH PAPER
FraudShield: Detection of Fraud in Credit Card based on Machine Learning Techniques with integration of web-based Framework
**Abstract**
In this paper, a general term for both fraud and theft committed with or while using a credit card for payment is "credit card fraud." In light of the daily increase in scammers, numerous different types of fraud are committed using credit cards. In order to address this issue, numerous methods like logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, and Naive Bayes algorithms are used. Various options are considered for this transaction, and the best one is implemented. Filtering out the above-mentioned tactics is done mostly to 
achieve the goal of detecting fraud and producing better results. Credit card fraud has increased due to the growing popularity of using credit cards for online purchases. The problem has been addressed through the use of machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions made with credit cards. In this paper, suggesting a system for detecting credit card fraud that employs machine learning techniques to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. In order to examine previous transaction data and spot trends that point to fraudulent activity, the proposed system combines both supervised and unsupervised methods of learning. Additionally combining the developed machine learning methods with a web-based 
platform to deliver an intuitive user interface for immediate form of fraud detection. The test findings demonstrate that the suggested framework detects fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy and with a minimal amount of false positives.
